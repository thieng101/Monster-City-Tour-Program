# Monster-City-Tour-Program
-You are in a monster city which is modeled on the Cartesian plane.\
-The proram takes in your location at the point (x,y) and the coordinates of all monsters around you in the city.\
-Then, the program will sort monsters'locations based on their distance from you, then displayed those sorted locations and performed some queries\
-Queries are to identify if there is a monster at that location, and if so, what their rank is on the sorted list of monsters. If no monster is at that location, you should correctly identify this.
